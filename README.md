# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

## Applied Data Science Capstone

This capstone project course will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data.

## WEEK 1

### Learning Objective and Syllabus

In this module, you will learn about the scope of this capstone course and the context of the project that you will be working on. You will also be required to submit a link to a new repository on your Github account dedicated to this course.

### Getting The Car Accident Severity Data

In this module, you will decide on what data you will use for the Capstone. As mentioned in Week-1, you have two options. The first option is to use shared dataset in this Capstone. The second option is to use another dataset that you find from different resources as mentioned in week-1 video. You will clearly define a problem and discuss the data that you will be using to solve the problem.

## WEEK 2

### Building Your Solution

In this module, you will learn how to start working on real world data. You will try different supervised machine learning algorithms. Then, you will select the machine learning model that gives you the highest prediction accuracy.

## WEEK 3

### Document and Submit Your Work

In this module, you will carry out all the remaining work to complete your capstone project. You will submit a report of your project for peer evaluation.

## Plan

## Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)

### Business Understanding

The initial phase is to understand the project's objective from the business or application perspective. Then, you need to translate this knowledge into a machine learning problem with a preliminary plan to achieve the objectives.

### Data understanding

In this phase, you need to collect or extract the dataset from various sources such as csv file or SQL database. Then, you need to determine the attributes (columns) that you will use to train your machine learning model. Also, you will assess the condition of chosen attributes by looking for trends, certain patterns, skewed information, correlations, and so on.

### Data Preparation

The data preparation includes all the required activities to construct the final dataset which will be fed into the modeling tools. Data preparation can be performed multiple times and it includes balancing the labeled data, transformation, filling missing data, and cleaning the dataset.

### Modeling

In this phase, various algorithms and methods can be selected and applied to build the model including supervised machine learning techniques. You can select SVM, XGBoost, decision tree, or any other techniques. You can select a single or multiple machine learning models for the same data mining problem. At this phase, stepping back to the data preparation phase is often required.

### Evaluation

Before proceeding to the deployment stage, the model needs to be evaluated thoroughly to ensure that the business or the applications' objectives are achieved. Certain metrics can be used for the model evaluation such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, precision, and others.

### Deployment

The deployment phase requirements vary from project to project. It can be as simple as creating a report, developing interactive visualization, or making the machine learning model available in the production environment. In this environment, the customers or end-users can utilize the model in different ways such as API, website, or so on.
