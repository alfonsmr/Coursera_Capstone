# Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM

This capstone project course will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data.

## WEEK 1

### Learning Objective and Syllabus

In this module, you will learn about the scope of this capstone course and the context of the project that you will be working on. You will also be required to submit a link to a new repository on your Github account dedicated to this course.
