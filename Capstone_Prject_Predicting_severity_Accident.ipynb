        "\n",
        "According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (1), Each day, more than 3500 people are killed in road traffic accidents around the world, more than half are pedestrians, motorcyclists or cyclists.\n",

        "The problem is even worse in third world countries, where although they are accountable for 60% of vehicles they get 90% of deaths. The road traffic deaths is three times higher in third world countries than high-income countries. The cost of road traffic injuries in the world is estimated at $518 billion USD, and 65 billion USD in third world countries that is more than those countries receive as development assistance.\n",
